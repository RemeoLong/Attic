      <h3>Mices</h3>
      <p>During the fall and winter months, mice will try to make their way indoors in search of food, warmth, and
        shelter. Not only can mice chew through walls and destroy food boxes in kitchen cabinets, but they can also
        wreak serious havoc on your home and personal health: They gnaw on wires, carry a slew of bacteria, and can
        worsen allergies and asthma for anyone living in the house. Because mice can travel in walls
        and under floorboards and in other difficult to access places in your home, you may see a lot of mouse damage
        before you see a mouse.</p>

      <h3>Rats</h3>
      <p>Rats, are one of the most common problems for both homes and businesses. They don’t care how big or how small
        the building is. They’re happy to work their way into any space where they might make a home. They’ve even been
        known to chew through metal and concrete! They reproduce quickly, forming huge swarms. Each one of those rats
        carries a pheromone in their fur which leaves a trail for other rodents and predators, who will work their way
        into the same spaces. </p>
      <p>They usually start appearing in fall and winter. The first thing you’ll notice are the sounds in the attic and
        walls, but their droppings will start causing problems soon enough if you don’t respond. They can and will soak
        your entire building down with the smell of urine even as they decimate your attic.</p>
